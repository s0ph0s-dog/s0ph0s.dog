I'm a 23-year-old timberwolf who lives in Toronto.  My pronouns are he/him/his.  For work, I write code, usually Python.  For fun, I _also_ write code, as well as administer OpenBSD and Linux servers, pretend to be a graphic designer, and read a lot of books.

# What I Do

I was formerly a software engineer for an FPGA vendor, where I worked on developer tools for a C++ to Verilog compiler.  However, I'm currently available for hire!

Outside of regular employment, I volunteer as a software developer and occasional sysadmin for the [XBN podcast network][xbn].  I've written [IRC bots][xana], [metadata management systems][gelo], and [post-production tools][postshow].

My current major project is an art archiving tool called [Werehouse](https://github.com/s0ph0s-2/werehouse), which makes it easy to preserve art that you care about—and share it with proper artist attribution!


# What I Enjoy

I run a home lab to learn more about OpenBSD and Linux systems administration.  I find that it's extremely beneficial to my software engineering skills to learn about what's going on beneath the software that I write, plus it's kinda fun to mess around with servers!

I also really enjoy graphic design as a hobby!  It's super fun to look at information and try to find an easily-understandable, eye-catching way to present it.  Most of what I do tends to come out looking fairly Swiss-modern, since I lack the artistic talent to produce things with more embellishment.

Away from my desk, I listen to a frightening amount of podcasts, try to read as many books as I can, and go for long runs to stave off the muscular atrophy and weight gain that tends to come with tech careers.  If you're looking for podcast recommendations, [I have a tag for that][podcast-recommendations]!  I also blog about [interesting books that I've read][books].  And whenever I can, I make sure to snuggle with my friends—particularly my adorable dragon boyfriend.


# For Artists

I'm a digitigrade, anthropomorphic hybrid of a timberwolf and a Shiba Inu.  I stand about 1.85 m tall (6 ft, 1 in), and weigh about 71 kg (156 lb).  My coat is typical for feral dark-furred timberwolves: dark on my body, darkest around my neck, white and fluffy on my chest and belly, and fading to gray toward my muzzle and paws.  The brown speckles in the fur on my back form a backslash character.  Unlike my feral counterparts, my irises are a bright, almost metallic gold.  Also, I dye my hair purple and paint my claws to match.  I wear gunmetal gray glasses, with rounded rectangular frames.

Sometimes, four limbs isn't enough.  I also have a taur variant, although the body shape details of this form are yet to be determined.  The backslash speckling only appears on the back of my upper torso, the lower torso is speckled more or less randomly.

Features taken from these wolf reference images:

* Lighter tufts in the middle of my ears (like № 3)
* Around-the-maw whitening (like in № 2, 4)
* Darkest fur color around my neck and in the middle of my tail (like in № 3)
* A white patch on my chest (like ref № 1, 2), which thins out and fades toward my belly (like in № 3), where it gets bigger again
* Lighter fur on my paws, fading up to match the darkest fur on my back and neck (like in № 4)
* Brownish peppering of the fur on my back, in the shape of a backslash character ‘\’ (similar to № 4)
* White peppering of the fur at the fringes of my tail (like № 4)
* Gold eyes, like the yellow in № 3, but approximately 15% more saturated and with almost-metallic glints
