[Ripley](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/smilingscorpio) did a wonderful job capturing this inside joke between Scale and I :3<!--more-->

I just love how she draws chibi charactersâ€”I look so cute blepping like this!
I'm so happy I get to enjoy the silly little things that have happened in my
relationship with Scale, and even happier that we get to remember them with art
now!

(You can ask me about the joke in-person if we know each other.)
