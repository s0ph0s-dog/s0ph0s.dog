His quadra-hinged maw is open on both axes with his teeth bared in a snarl, and both of his tongues are out.  He's very scruffy and gangly-looking."

[WolfhideWinter](https://whwinter.carrd.co) painted this excellent sketch of my alien werewolf after a… scuffle :P<!--more-->

I've been a fan of his style for a while, and I'm very glad I got the
opportunity to commission him!  One of these days, I'm going to ask him about
something with a background too—he's *very* good at portraying the unsettling
and mysterious energy of a forest with Something Else in it.
