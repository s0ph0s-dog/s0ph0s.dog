[zanger danger](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zrkzsaqqa33namszrfxy525u) drew this amazing bust of my alien werewolf!<!--more-->

I love the newspaper clippings in the background!  They give a perfect "weird cryptid" vibe.  And the shine/drips on the tentacles are so juicy!  The halftone-style shading also looks really good.  I'm so happy with this one :3
