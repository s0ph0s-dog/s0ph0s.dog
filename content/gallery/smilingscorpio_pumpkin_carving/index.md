Scaltrox, on the left, has carved a vaguely distressed-looking jack-o-lantern face into his pumpkin.  s0ph0s, on the right, has caved a smiling jack-o-lantern face into his pumpkin.  There is a bowl of pumpkin guts next to s0ph0s."

[SmilingScorpio](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/smilingscorpio) drew this lovely piece of Scale and I carving pumpkins!  And just in time for Halloween :3<!--more-->

The vibes in this are awesome, I love how well SmilingScorpio captured both the warmth of company and the chill gray of Fall evenings.  If only my apartment building allowed decorative gourds in the hallwayâ€¦
