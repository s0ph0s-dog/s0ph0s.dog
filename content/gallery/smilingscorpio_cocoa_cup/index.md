[SmilingScorpio](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/smilingscorpio/) drew this absolutely adorable rendition of the three of us for the holidays!<!--more-->

She wanted to try a chibi style, but wasn't sure how it would turn out. The result was all three of us cropping it for our profile pictures immediatelyâ€”in other words, she nailed it! I particularly love how I'm draped over a marshmallow with my tongue out. It's so cute!

Merry Christmas, Scale, and Happy Hanukkah, Oz!  I'm so glad we got to spend the holidays together :3
