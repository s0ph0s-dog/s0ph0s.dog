[Silvixen](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/silvixen) perfectly captured the joy I felt finishing my degrees!<!--more-->

I'm looking forward to hanging this piece on the wall next to my diplomas. Between the two, this makes me much happier to look at. I look so fluffy and excited!

Also, I am especially grateful to Silvixen for both putting up with my nitpicks about how the weird master's degree sleeves look, and for taking the very fake-looking and stilted reference photos I provided and making them into this pose, which is so much more flowing and happy!
