A cosmic horror animation commission by [Azrealm](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/azrealm/)!  She absolutely nailed it :3<!--more-->

Earlier this year, Azrealm mentioned that she wanted to animate more spooky monster creatures.  Almost immediately, I knew what my Halloween commission plan would be!  I'm extremely happy with how this turned out, and I'm so glad it's finally done!  Especially the detached hand's latex tentacles and the final frame with the awesome view of his open maw!
