There is a glowing, red summoning circle on the ground, with chains coming out of it to bind s0ph0s in place.  The demon's humanoid dick is twice as long as s0ph0s' head, and about as thick around. s0ph0s is looking up at the demon somewhat hesitantly."

[Gariyuu](https://subscribestar.adult/gariyuu) put out a call for monsterfuckers who would be interested in having a go with his demon character, and I immediately jumped at the opportunity!<!--more-->

I love the way he drew the glow of the summoning circle, and also the absolute
heft of Murmurs' erection~  This is also part one of a two-part series, so look
out for more of Murmurs having his way with s0ph0s in the next few months!

Also, I was inspired to write a story to go along with this one, please enjoy :3

***

Perhaps the wolf should have stopped and reconsidered when he decided that he
didn't need to follow *all* of the steps of the ritual.  If someone is too
squeamish to sacrifice a goat, they probably should not be conducting dark
rituals.  However, he barreled forward, chalking the summoning circle onto the
basement floor, arranging and lighting the candles, and igniting the white sage
sprig in the incense burner.  The final steps in this ritual were to recite
something in Latin and spill a drop of his own blood on the summoning circle.
He had practiced reciting the text for hours, because every source he found
repeated dire warnings about what might happen to those who chant imprecisely.

"Veni, imple sacramentum tuum. Servio… hac nocte," he finished, tucking the book
under one arm.  He pricked the side of his pawpad, squeezing a drop of blood
onto the center of the chalk star. His eyes traced the path of the droplet
toward the ground while his brain turned over the words he had spoken.
Something about the last sentence felt weird, but a half-remembered high
school Latin curriculum wasn't doing him any favors.

That thought vanished when the droplet struck the ground.  At that moment, the
air conditioner clicked off, the frogs and crickets went silent, and everything
was much too quiet.  Instinctively, he raised his hackles and began to pad
backwards away from the circle.  Every second of sinister silence made him more
uncomfortable.  One errant creature made a bizarre, off-key chirrup.  He almost
jumped out of his skin.

He opened back up the book and read further, looking for the notes about how to
dispel whatever he had summoned.  Uneasy page flips sliced through the silence.
"Hnngh," he muttered, and flipped back to the start of the ritual to see if he
had missed it.  Flip, flip, flip--no, he hadn't.  Well, he remembered reading
something about disrupting the circle to stop the ritual, so he dropped the book
and reached to wipe away the chalk.  He tripped over his own paws.  Was he that
nervous?

No--he started to stand up, only to finally notice the earth shaking.  In front
of him, the candles wavered.  Concrete crumbled and yawned open.  Swelteringly
humid air creeped up out of the chasm.  The light from the candles seemed to shy
away from the edges of the crack.  Inside, there was nothing.  Even his
dark-adapted lupine vision couldn't see the *walls*.  But he could hear
something.  Voices?

Whispers, maybe.

Getting closer.

One clawed hand reached out of the void and smacked against the summoning
circle.  Another scratched against the ground on the other side.  They heaved,
and a great, horned skull rose upwards, uncomfortably askew.  The whispers were
*here*.  They flooded the basement and poured into his head.  He flinched and
covered his ears. The whispers continued, unabated.

The creature stepped free of the chasm, towering over the wolf even while
hunched forward.  A long, ivory tail curled up out of the darkness and slowly
swished behind him.  The wolf's breath caught in his throat--how badly had he
messed up?

Casually, the demon stretched his back.  His too-long arms reached rearward, and
then a series of uncomfortably wet cracks and pops cut through the incessant
whispers.  Beneath his clawed footpaws, the chalk lines began to emit a silvery
glow.  As his hands reached closer to the edge of the circle, the silvery wisps
became a faint cylinder around the whole symbol, spanning from floor to ceiling.
It briefly stopped the demon's stretch, containing him for a moment.

Then he stretched further.  The glowing cylinder shattered into a fine mist,
fading to nothing.  A sickening crack accompanied his last vertebra
returning to place, leveling his head.  And then his empty, dark eye sockets
surveyed the basement, landing on the stunned wolf.

One unsettling arm reached out past where the protective barrier was moments
ago, heading for the terrified wolf.  And then it dipped down, picking up the
open book from the floor.  He held it up to his chalk-white face, tilting his
horned head slightly.  He flipped a page.  The wolf looked on, now equal parts
horrified and confused.  Then the demon began to convulse, silently bouncing and
beginning to tilt his head back.  He slapped the book against his thigh, and the
convulsions increased.  A rhythmic hissing, grinding noise cut through the
din.  Even over the sound of the murmuring, this new auditory assault made the
wolf shudder, squint, and recoil.  Through squinted eyes, the demon's
convulsions and grinding snapped to a different explanation: laughing.

Indignant, and no longer paralyzed with fear, the wolf shouted, "Are you mocking
me?"  In response, the creature wordlessly reached out one claw.  The whispering
voices grew more frenetic, until his claw raked through the wolf's fur and
touched his skin.  His vision went white, and he was overtaken by some kind of
hallucination--no, someone else's memory.  Two other creatures in robes,
standing around a familiar-looking summoning circle, chanting "…entum tuum.
**Servite mihi** hac nocte."  Even though they were clearly chanting Latin, he
somehow knew instinctively that their words meant "Serve me tonight."  The
demon's claw pulled back, and he thought about the chant he had rehearsed so
many times.  "Servio… I am a servant."

"Well shit."

The demon's claws were around his neck in an instant.  A strangled yelp crashed
out of the wolf, who found himself thrown shoulders-first onto the summoning
circle.  The chalk lines were now smoldering as if they were molten, filling the
swampy air with a sanguine glow.  Before he could even catch his breath,
something wrenched his neck and wrists to the ground.  He tried to look down,
but his muzzle hit something hard.  Was that smell blood?  No, iron.  Demonic
manacles.

His eyes followed the demon walking up to, then standing over him.  Until this
moment, he had not realized that the demon was naked, but it was suddenly *very*
apparent.  Two fist-sized orbs, scarred with Futhark runes, hung lower than the
forearm-sized shaft in front of them.  Then one of the demon's too-long arms
reached down and grabbed the wolf by his headfur.  With a forceful shove and the
clattering of mysically summoned chains, his nose landed in the sweaty, stinking
pit where the beast's shaft joined his scrotum.  And the wolf couldn't avoid
breathing in, because he was still winded.

Demonic musk curled through sensitive canine nasal folds, reeking of sweat and
dirt and salt.  It was… overpowering.  Some part of the wolf knew he should be
describing it as awful, vile, or putrid, but those words refused to stick in his
mind.  He breathed deeper.  Overpowering, but not bad.  What would it taste
like?  Wait, he shouldn't be tasting anyth… his tongue had already touched the
drenched, wrinkled skin of the demon's sack, and sent an explosion of flavors and
thoughts through the baser parts of his brain.  He was *meant* to do this.  He
was *meant* to lap at these leather-wrapped orbs, savoring the glistening beads
of pure masculinity that rolled down it.  He was *meant* to sit here, on his
knees, admiring this towering, muscular specimen as the cacophony of whispers
washed over him.  The wolf's golden irises peered up at the creature's vacant
sockets from around the shaft draped over his head, and the situation seemed
less frightening. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad, serving this demon for just one
night…
