This was an excellent YCH by [Kitchi](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/kitchidrachenblut/), who drew a lovely version of my alien werewolf's weird junk :3

I love the framing, and the happy trail on his balls!  He sure would be an *interesting* creature to run into in a back alley~

Also, fluids alt!
